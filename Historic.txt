Sercice Point Locator project historic
--------------------------------------

2010/06/16 V 1.0.0.0
	Starting SPL project based on a previous one released in May
	The first goal was to change the global code architecture to a layered base code approach (Graphic User Interface / Business Logic Layer / Data Acces Layer)
2010/06/17 v1.0.0.0
	Add MapControl: a UserControl having only a pictureBox where the map will be draw
	Add UserInterface: class which handle settings, bitmap loading and bitmap preprocessing
2010/06/21 v1.0.0.0
	Add DeptInfoControl. Just starting the UI design
	Test the application on other unit to determine minimal resolution and plan various scenarios about form behevior
2010/06/22 v1.0.0.0
	Finish a first approach of the UI design. The new idea is to use this control to display also the result of a search on Google or Bing Maps sites
		The control is defined in 3 parts :
		1- At the top the banner
		2- Below a panel
		3- Inside the panel, one or more subbanner, each containing texts and a email link in a subpanel
		Notice that each subpanel could be open and close using a arrow showed in the subbanner
		A solution to copy the contains of the subpanel to the clipboard is still in construction (by a small icon, text hightlighted and so one)
	Add SqlDB class in charge of the SQL and data handling
2010/06/23 v1.0.0.0
	Finish SqlDB class
	Add ServicePointData class
	SQL storage cancelled by Diane
		Looking for a new storage system, like XLS file, CSV or XML
2010/06/25 v1.0.0.0
	Add XmlDB class which replace SqlDB. Now a unique formatted XLS file is used as data source.
		A MS add-in is used to export data in XML format from Excel.
		The application first try to find the file in a shared directoy and fellow the same bahavior than SqlDB process.
		If found, it copy the file localy and fill-in the ServicePoint structures, else, it loads the local file.
2010/06/29 v1.0.0.0
	Fill-in the XLS DB (not completely...)
2010/06/30 v1.0.0.0
	Rename UserInterface in UiData
		Add some bitmap resources loading
	Rename DeptInfoControl in LeafletControl
		Finish container drawing/handling
		Start LeaftletData class used for manage button-like children
2010/07/01 v1.0.0.0
	Big progress with LeafletControl
		Finish child drawing
		Handle control behavior when click on arrow & email link
		Remaining text copy to clipboard; the current idea is to use a small icon but where to put it ? Wait for live DB tests before validate a solution.
2010/07/02 v1.0.0.0
	Change the approach of map showing in UI.
		Because there are some heavy bitmap preprocessing before showing the map and because aliasing and scaling could badly impact the visibility,
		the map is now shown unscaled in its client-area. To see cover part of the map, the user should maintain the left mouse button pushed and move the mouse.
		The map will scroll according to the user action until he releases the button. Double-clicking will select a department (its color change to red).
		Right clicking will unselect the department if selected (and restore its color).
		Notice that the size of the map could be reduce from 20% because the informations will not be shown on the map anymore (no more tipinfo  like the previous project)
		So on resolution height >= 900 the map will be totally visible.
	Remove useless picturebox container in MapControl
	Change Font type to Segoe UI (present on WinXP sp3) because interleave is greater than Segoe or other Font
	Change Font title to Bodoni
	Increase the width of the LeaftControl to 300
	Graphics tests: email icons, icon type in the banner title, copy to clipboard icon etc
2010/07/05 v1.0.0.0
	Try safe and unsafe code to set region from a specific color and refill it with an other color
	Complete the ServicePointDB (nearly a live DB)
	Remove Form ratio resizing by a free resizing with a maximum that depends on the size of children (mainly the Map size)
	Handle MapControl area visibility when smaller than the bitmap
2010/07/06 v1.0.0.0
	Replace Region with GraphicsPath because the localisation methods are not needed.
		The application still works with a color detection mecanism
		GraphicsPath are faster (about 30%)
	Optimize GraphicsPath object creation (one pass on the Map)
2010/07/07 v1.0.0.0
	Add departement detection and drawing
	Change department detection using an exclusive bitmap because of flags (flag drawing not implemented yet)
	Add events in MapControl to handle when select and unselect an object
	Add functions to get & format data from DB
2010/07/08 v1.0.0.0
	Fix bad parameter value in GetDepartmentData while calling GetServicePoint() function
	Fix strange Map scrolling when moving again the Map
		Rewrite all the code
	Fix bug in LoadSettings (Y coordonates for all flag were set to 0...) 
	Change drawing order for flags
		Now the flags are drawn at the end of the graphic pipe. This is not a big deal even for slow computer.
		The problem when drawing them during preprocessing map is alpha channel. Transparents pixels will be exclude from
		graphicspath creation, so the previous color still be visible when drawing the graphicspath (red color). 
		Moreover, it will increase drasticaly the preprocessing Map by updating all graphicspath which means, increase by a factor 2 the time consuming
		to perform preprocessing operations.
2010/07/09 v1.0.0.0
	Decrease size of the Title in MapControl from 11.5 to 10.5
	Remove from UiData class all fixed bitmap used in controls
		Those "static" bitmaps are load and handle by their control
	Add email glyph in Leaflet control
	Add "copy to clipboard" button
	Add glyph in title
		This is a properties so it could be change dynamicaly
	In Mainform handle event when copy to clipboard occurs
	Starting UI design for Locator control
2010/07/15 v1.0.0.0
	Add LocatorControl class
	Remove MAXIMIZE button in MainForm
	Draw department number in flag (MapControl)
	Remove useless dummy department "00" in data.xml
	Many changes in UiData
		- Remove all test of dummy department
		- Remove useless Flag bitmap from struct Department 
	Many changes in Mapcontrol:
		- Remove m_MapResource because the color test could be done in the same map (safe memory and simplify code)
		- Map bitmap is loaded from resource when MapControl initialise itself, mainly to prevent designer crash 
		- Flag bitmap is now a property
	Start SPL installer
2010/07/16 V1.0.0.0
	Finish installer
		- Create new UI for Mercura (valided by Diane)
		- Add shortcut in desktop + start menu
		- Upgrade if newer version, repair if same version and exit is older
	Remake the Map (new size is 70% of the original)
		The reason is the first Map was design to display tooltips, so the visible area should be wide.
		The new design can handle easily small map and it is better for the user. Now, for most of the resolutions, the application will be maximize.
		The scroll of the Map still	be handling for small resolution (height < 768)
	Resize Flag and change its DPI from 72 to 96...
2010/07/18 v1.0.0.0 RTM
	Change all Flag coordonates in data.xml
	Change "Copy to Clipboard" button bitmap and position
	Design a Email editor => cancelled by Diane
		She wants the application open outlook itself but how it select a mail (devis or intervention) ?
		It will be difficult to add something in the UI to do this => force to use interops office ?
 	Finish design of locator
	Release V1.0.0.0
	Start Bing map API implementation

2010/07/30 v1.0.0.1
	Remake severals business logic methods to handle the adding of new entry in leaflet control
		The goal is to have something uniform with others requests coming from other control and not only MapControl 
	Add an event in Corelayer class to send text to all object than subscribe it.
		By this way, LocatorControl status text can be refresh from other class than UI ones
	Add the drawing of status message in LeafletControl class
2010/09/08 v1.0.0.1
	Add mouse click on search bitmap in LocatorControl
2010/09/23 v1.0.0.1

2010/10/01 v1.0.0.1
	Complete OnLocatorSearch() in MainForm
		Clear Map and Leaflet controls (see FIXME)
		Create new entries in Leaflet control (see TODO)
	Add GetServicePointAndSearchText() method in CoreLayer class
		This is a clone of GetServicePointText()

2010/10/05 v1.0.0.1
	Add ParseSearch method to extract postal code and city name from user input coming from locatorcontrol
		Now postal code and city name can be put together in the request, so the algo search 5 succeeding digit and only characters for the rest of the string (because there is no digit in city name)
	Add ShowInfoMessage in CoreLayer class to handle info messages sent to LocatorControl
		This can be call by the MainForm or other class. Type of message is introdiuce. LocatorControl class will determines text color (and perhaps small glyph) according to the type of message.

	Fix incorrect behavior of servicepoint selection when search request imply corse departments because the minimum of 3 service point found is never reach
	Fix multiples same service point shown as results in the leaflet control
		Service point list was not clear while a new graph search using a deeper threshold is needed
	Fix cost calculation error (only on way of the travel was count...)
	Add the checking of the screen resolution
		Exit application if under  or equal to 800 in width and 600 in heifht

	Change cost computing
		Introduice PackageDeal in the cost calculating. KilometricRate is prior to PackageDeal.
2010/10/16 v1.1.0.0
	Change Hue offset, because Hue in file settings is the wanted value not an offset
	Change RDB covertion to HSL wtih HSV (there is soeting wrong with this because saturation is always 1 ?)
	Release v1.1.0.0

TODO List
---------
- add tooltip info on email link
- add LocatorControl Resizing method
- Reamke ico with 256 colors for winxp that not handle transparency with 16 or 24 bits pixel size...
